## Insights & Recommendations
1) **City Performance**
   - Hurghada is the highest in revenue, while Cairo However has high occupancy, suffers from many cancellations. Itâ€™s important to find out why Cairo has so many cancellations.

2) **Elite Customers**
   - Need to focus more on Elite customers because they drive the revenue boost, and it has the highst cancelation should be prioritized more as it has the highest influence on revenue
(like better communication or flexible booking options)

3) **Trend Changes**
   - Revenue, bookings, and cancellations started decreased on July 10, 2022, then decreased notably on July 26, 2022. This suggests something changed during that period, so further investigation is needed.
